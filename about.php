        <h2>You’re looking for an experience of the holy.</h2>
        <p>One that is strong enough to lean on, deep enough to question, and challenging enough to change you.</p>
        <p>If you’re not sure what you believe, rest assured that neither are we.  We place practice before belief, trusting that the practice of eating, praying, and singing together that moves us deeper into faith. Instead of trying to figure out what we believe, we’re trying to live what we practice.</p>

          <h3>Emily Scott, Pastor</h3>
          <p>Emily Scott imagines her ministry as "creating space for moments of transcendence through ritual." At St. Lydia’s, these moments take place around a common table where God comes and finds us. Trained as a liturgist and musician at Yale Divinity School and the Institute of Sacred Music, Emily has followed a particular interest in the intersection of worship and the arts. She founded St. Lydia's in collaboration with colleague Rachel Pollak and congregants in 2009, and was ordained as a pastor in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in 2012.</p>
          <p>Emily served as the Director of Worship at the Riverside Church in the City of New York from 2007-2009, then as the Director of Family Music Ministries at First Presbyterian Church in the City of New York from 2009-2013. Emily collaborated with <a href="http://www.allsaintscompany.org/">All Saints Company</a> to found and coordinate “Music That Makes Community,” a network of clergy and musicians interested in composing and leading congregational music from the oral tradition and train church leaders to do the same. As part of her work, she oversaw the publication of <a href="http://www.churchpublishing.org/products/index.cfm?fuseaction=productDetails&productID=3266">Music By Heart</a>, a hymnal of paperless music.</p>
          <p>Emily posts her writing and sermons on her blog, <a href="http://sitandeat.typepad.com/blog/">Sit and Eat</a>, and on her podcast, <a href="http://brokenbread.podbean.com/">Broken Bread</a>.</p>

          <h3>Julia Stroud, Community Coordinator</h3>
          <p>After four years working in television and theater, Julia Macy Stroud found herself studying Systematic Theology at Union Theological Seminary, where she won the Karen Ziegler Feminist Preaching Prize and graduated with a Master of Divinity in 2014. She's passionate about feminist theology, queer theory, and anything with a liberative bent; Julia is especially interested in what good theology can look like when it's working in real faith communities.</p>
          <p>Julia is also the Program Minister at <a href="http://allsaintsparkslope.com/">All Saints' Church</a> in Park Slope, Brooklyn. There, she works with children and youth, preaches regularly on Sunday mornings, and manages their social media. As a Crown Heights-dweller, she may often be found listening to comedy podcasts while crossing Prospect Park.</p>
          <p>A Twitter-Facebook-Instagram-Tumblr-etc enthusiast, Julia's not ashamed to be found with her phone in her hand. Please feel free to friend and follow her across all platforms; she's especially on the lookout for good pictures of us here at St. Lydia's!</p>

Zachary came to St. Lydia’s three years ago as part of a Lutheran Worship class, and fell in love with the community, the liturgy, and of course, the food!

          <h3>Sarah McCaslin, Waffle Church Minister</h3>
          <p>Sarah is an ordained minister and licensed social worker whose career has been devoted to fostering the human capacity for resilience, growth and meaning-making. After many years working with the homeless and mentally ill, followed by seven years in parish ministry, Sarah has turned her attention to counseling, mostly recently as a staff therapist at the Psychotherapy and Spirituality Institute. But her heart is in the liturgical life of the community, and she continues to guest preach whenever possible. For community is itself a sacrament, and worship is one of the best places she knows to encounter the mystery of God together. Sarah lives in Brooklyn with her husband and two children--Claire, age 6, and Henry, age 3 1/2, who are theologians in the very best sense of the word.</p>
