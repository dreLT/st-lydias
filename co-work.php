      <p>Working side by side, in the midst of community.<br />
      A shared office space for freelancers in Gowanus, Brooklyn</p>
      <p>We’ve created a place where anyone who would normally work from home or a coffee shop can work alongside one another in a quiet, focused, communal environment in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn.</p>
      <p>This is a space for anyone, of any or no faith, looking for a more spiritually connected way to live and work.</p>
      <p>Why work here instead of at home?</p>
      <h3>A Beautiful, Quiet Space</h3>
      <p>We've got a comfortable, light-filled workspace with a nice big kitchen, lots of outlets and really good wifi, perfect for being very productive.</p>
      <h3>Better Than a Coffee Shop</h3>
      <p>When you work at a coffee shop, you have to take your stuff with you every time you run out for an errand. The Wi-Fi is spotty, and you have to keep buying coffee! As a co-worker, you can leave your stuff here when you run out, trust that the Wi-Fi will always be running, print and photocopy, and make your own coffee (for free!) whenever you want. Plus, you’re connecting each day to a group of motivated co-workers.</p>
      <h3>Spiritually Grounded and Connected</h3>
      <p>As we grow, we’re building a networked community of freelancers with opportunities for afternoon yoga breaks, silent meditation, workshops for sharing ideas, CSA pickups, and whatever else you can think of!</p>
      <h4>Coffee, Tea, Free Lunch and Cookie Thursday!</h4>
      <p>Working at a Dinner Church means the fridge tends to be packed with leftovers from services the night before that are up for grabs. We offer free coffee and tea, and a big kitchen where you can make your lunch. On Wednesdays, who ever wants to shares a yummy meal provided by St. Lydia's. That, plus warm cookies every Thursday afternoon makes for a pretty pleasant work environment.</p>
      <h4>It's Close to Everything</h4>
      <p>We’re located in Gowanus, close to restaurants in Carroll Gardens, and adjacent to Park Slope. There’s plenty of restaurants nearby. There are plenty of restaurants nearby, and we're a short walk from the Union stop on the R and the Carroll stop on the F/G.</p>
      <h4>Some of the Cheapest Co-working in Brooklyn</h4>

      <h3 class="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
      <h4 class="question">Do I have to be churchy, Christian, or involved with St. Lydia’s to be a co-worker?</h4>
      <p class="answer">No! Co-working at St. Lydia’s is for those of any or no faith. You don’t have to be religious, or even spiritual to work here. We like being a place where all sorts of people cross paths.</p>
      <h4 class="question">Are you secretly trying to convert me?</h4>
      <p class="answer">No. That would be weird and creepy and we would never do that. Also, trying to convert people is not our idea of what a church should be up to. Our goal is to create an open, communal space where folks can work together.</p>
      <h4 class="question">Can I have a full time desk at St. Lydia’s, where I keep all my stuff?</h4>
      <p class="answer">Sadly, no. Our co-working space is a day-time space, where you can come to work during the day, bringing what you need with you. We don’t offer offices, cubicles, or full time desks. However, if you have a need to store a limited amount of stuff, we can add a storage basket or bin to your plan.</p>
      <h4 class="question">Is there a photocopier and printer I can use?</h4>
      <p class="answer">Yes! You’re welcome to make use of ours.</p>
      <h4 class="question">Can I make phone calls or have colleagues come by for conversations?</h4>
      <p class="answer">Sure. We ask for co-workers to simply keep their voice low when they’re on the phone. There will be two curtained areas for a little more privacy on a phone call. And you’re welcome to have colleagues come by to work with you on a limited basis. If they’ll be here often, you might consider a part time membership for them.</p>
      <h4 class="question">How does access to the space work?</h4>
      <p class="answer">You’ll be given an access code so that you can key into the building between 8:00 am and 6:30 pm each day. One of the ways we keep the space cheap is by not having a recpetionist, so you’re free to come and go as you plese. Evening events at St. Lydia’s may begin set up at 6:00 or so, and co-workers are invited to stay in the space until 6:30.</p>
      <h4 class="question">Do you rent your space?</h4>
      <p class="answer">Yes, contact us for more information. We also partner with selected not-for-profits and arts organizations.</p>
