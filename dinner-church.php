      <h2>Share the Meal</h2>
      <p>At Dinner Church, worship takes place at the table around a big, delicious meal that we cook together. Communion is made as we share food and ourselves by exploring scripture, singing, and praying together.</p>
      <h3>Tell the Story</h3>
      <p>Telling Our Story: Jesus told a lot of stories, and so do we. We tell the story of Christ’s dying and rising, and through it, uncover the daily dyings and risings that comprise our lives.</p>
      <h3>Work Together</h3>
      <p>When you arrive at St. Lydia’s, you’ll be put straight to work preparing dinner or setting the table. Working together unites us as a community and brings us closer to God.</p>
      <p>Every Sunday Night, arrive between 5:30 and 6:00<br />
      Every Monday Night, arrive between 6:30 and 7:00</p>

      <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
      <h4 class="question">Dinner Church? Is that a thing?</h4>
      <p class="answer">Well, now it is! “Dinner Church” is a phrase we’ve coined to describe what we do when we gather at St. Lydia’s. Sharing a meal is a tradition from the earliest days of the church—one that we’re reviving in our practice together.</p>
      <h4 class="question">I’d like to come! Should I just show up?</h4>
      <p class="answer">Yes, just show up! If you like you can <a href="mailto:stlydias@stlydias.org">write us</a> and we'll be expecting you. If you're visiting with a group, keep reading!</p>
      <h4 class="question">Should I bring anything?</h4>
      <p class="answer">There's no need to bring anything, though if you feel inspired to pick up dessert or a bunch of flowers, we will gladly receive them! Dessert takes place during the hubbub of cleanup, so cookies or treats that don't require plates or silverware work well. We do not serve alcohol at our meals, so please refrain from bringing wine.</p>
      <h4 class="question">When should I arrive? How long is your worship?</h4>
      <p class="answer">We begin our worship by working together to prepare the meal. Arrive any time between 5:30 and 6:00 pm on Sundays and 6:30 and 7:00 pm on Mondays.  Worship concludes around 8:00 pm on Sundays and 9:00 pm on Mondays.</p>
      <h4 class="question">How many people usually come?</h4>
      <p class="answer">Lately, there are 20-30 people.  We try to keep the experience intimate.</p>
      <h4 class="question">Are children welcome at Dinner Church?</h4>
      <p class="answer">Absolutely! Children of all ages are more than welcome, and will be doted on and adored by the congregation. There’s room in our service for kids to wander, and participate. We also have a kids basket filled with chalk, crayons, and books for your children to explore.</p>
      <h4 class="question">I have dietary restrictions. Will I be able to eat?</h4>
      <p class="answer">All of our meals are healthy and vegetarian (but not vegan). They are often gluten and lactose free, but not always. We usually have dessert at the end of worship during announcements. If you have allergies to particular foods or have other food-related concerns, please <a href="mailto:stlydias@stlydias.org">send us an e-mail</a> and let us know. If you need to receive gluten free bread at the Eucharist, it’s helpful if you remind us when you arrive.</p>
      <h4 class="question">I don’t drink alcohol.</h4>
      <p class="answer">We do not drink wine as a part of our meal. Grape juice and water are offered instead.</p>
      <h4 class="question">What should I wear?</h4>
      <p class="answer">Whatever you would like!  Congregants tend to dress casually.</p>
      <h4 class="question">Is St. Lydia’s wheelchair accessible?</h4>
      <p class="answer">By this fall, our space will be wheelchair accessible. St. Lydia's is located on the first floor, but there is a small step to enter the building. The bathroom is fully accessible.</p>
      <h4 class="question" id="out-of-town-visitors">I’m visiting with a group or from out of town to learn about St. Lydia’s.</h4>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>We're glad you'd like to visit St. Lydia's, and are happy to welcome groups of 4-6 people. Because St. Lydia's is a fairly intimate experience (generally 30 or so people at each service) groups much larger than that can be a little overwhelming for the congregation. If your group is larger than 4-6, you might consider splitting over a Sunday and Monday night. Please <a href="mailto:stlydias@stlydias.org">write us</a> as far in advance as possible and let us know you're coming so we can make sure to cook enough food!</p>
        <p>St. Lydia's is a small and growing congregation, and as we've grown, we've been glad to welcome and get to know folks who come from around the country to worship with us. However, as the number of visitors has increased, we've needed to be mindful of the impact this has on the congregation. Here are a few ways to make your pilgrimage to St. Lydia's work well for you and for the congregation.</p>
        <h5>Be a participant in worship, rather than an observer.</h5>
        <p>We're here to make worship together, and so are you! When you arrive at St. Lydia's, you'll be invited to help create our liturgy, by cooking in the kitchen or setting the table. Jump in! You're part of what we're doing together.</p>
        <h5>Engage in conversation during worship, saving your questions for after the service.</h5>
        <p>Our congregants come to St. Lydia's to experience the Divine. Some of them come every week, others are coming for the very first time, perhaps with some fear or trepidation about attending church. They're there to build relationships. When you're a curious visitor, it can be tempting to pepper congregants with questions. However, this can make us feel like we're being interviewed when we're just trying to worship. Please save your questions about St. Lydia's and the way we worship until after the service. Emily will be more than glad to speak with you afterward.</p>
        <p>At the dinner table, we invite you to simply engage those around you about normal old things. "Where are you from?" "How long have you lived in New York?" and "What were you up to this week?" are all great conversation starters.</p>
        <h5>After the service, attend a "What Did You Notice" session.</h5>
        <p>Often after the service, our rehearsal leader will draw the worship leaders and whoever else is interested together for a "what did you notice" session. This is a time for leaders to simply notice what happened during the service. It's a great time for you to learn about the way the service is put together and our values in carrying it out.</p>
        <h5>Do some reading in advance.</h5>
        <p>There are a number of resources available that can help you learn about St. Lydia's in advance of your visit. This article in <a href="http://www.faithandleadership.com/features/articles/dinner-and-the-gospel-served-st-lydias">Faith and Leadership</a> describes how we got started, and this <a href="http://www.nyspirit.com/issue/168/spirit-interview/hungry-for-a-connection">interview with Emily</a> may be helpful to you. We also recommend this longer radio interview on <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/lifecoachradionetwork/2015/01/27/spiritually-speaking-with-rev-jen-and-rebecca">Spiritually Speaking</a>, in which Emily describes the process of St. Lydia's getting off the ground.</p>

Our <a href="http://stlydias.org/blog/">blog</a> is also a treasure trove of information.  <a href="http://stlydias.org/blog/category/squeezebox/">"Squeezebox"</a> is a section where we post all the music we sing in worship. There are blog posts about our practice of singing <a href="http://stlydias.org/blog/2013/06/songs-for-saint-lydias%E2%80%94how-we-choose-our-repertoire/">here</a>, <a href="http://stlydias.org/blog/2013/06/the-spiritual-practice-of-song-leading-at-saint-lydias/">here</a> and <a href="http://stlydias.org/blog/2013/06/what-song-leaders-work-on-in-rehearsal/">here</a>.

        <h5>Make an offering.</h5>
        <p>It takes a lot of dough to run a Dinner Church! Our operating budget includes money for rent, salaries, supplies, and of course, the food that we put on the table twice a week. Congregants who attend each week and donors from all across the country are an integral part of keeping our doors open and the lights on at St. Lydia's. We invite you to participate in building St. Lydia's by offering your support. You can offer cash in the plate when you visit, or you can take a few moments to donate online by clicking the green button on the top right of this page. Consider making a recurring gift! It's folks like you who make St. Lydia's a reality.</p>

      <h4 class="question">Why is your worship centered around a meal?</h4>
      <p class="answer">Worship at St. Lydia’s is based on the worship in the Early Church. In the second and third centuries, Christians gathered for sacred meals they called the Eucharist (a Greek word that means “thanksgiving”). Jesus and many of his first followers were Jewish, so the meals were related to Jewish Sabbath supper and Seder meals, and involved blessing bread and a cup. The meals shared by these early Christians were the great-great grandparent of our modern Eucharist, also called Communion or the Lord’s Supper.</p>
      <h4 class="question">Is this meal a Eucharist?</h4>
      <p class="answer">Yes. We bless our meal with the earliest known Eucharistic Prayer called the Didache, drawn from the second century. Our pastor, Emily Scott, chants the prayer. The congregation sings a response during the blessing, then shares the bread saying, “This is my body.”</p>
