      <h2 class="headline faq-headline">Frequently Asked<br /> Questions</h2>
      <h3 class="question">I’d like to come! Should I just show up?</h3>
      <p class="answer">Yes, you can just show up at any of our worship services. If you like you can <a href="mailto:stlydias@stlydias.org">write us</a> in advance and we’ll be ready to welcome you. If you're visiting with a group, keep reading!</p>
      <h3 class="question">What does it mean that you're "progressive?"</h3>
      <p class="answer">It means that we approach the bible both spiritually and intellectually, we embrace sexuality and all sexual orientations, and we affirm the spiritual journeys of those of other faiths.</p>
      <h3 class="question">Are you Christian?</h3>
      <p class="answer">Yes. We're a group of people who tell the story of Christ's dying and rising, and through it, uncover the daily dyings and risings that comprise our lives. We’re affiliated with the <a href="http://www.elca.org/">Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</a> (a progressive Lutheran denomination) and supported by the <a href="http://www.episcopalchurch.org/">Episcopal Church</a> as well. </p>
      <h3 class="question">I’m not sure what I believe. Can I come?</h3>
      <p class="answer">Absolutely! You’ll be in good company. At St. Lydia’s, we place practice before belief. It’s the practice of eating, praying, and singing together that moves us deeper into faith. Instead of trying to figure out what we believe, we’re trying to live what we practice.
      <h3 class="question">I am gay, bi, trans, straight, queer or something in between.</h3>
      <p class="answer">And we are glad! We are a progressive, gay-friendly and queer-affirming Church, and we hope that you will bring your whole self to worship.</p>
      <h3 class="question">Are children welcome in worship?</h3>
      <p class="answer">Absolutely! Children of all ages are more than welcome, and will be doted on and adored by the congregation. Dinner Church runs a little late for really little ones (we usually finish worship at 9:00) but you’re welcome to slip out before the service is entirely over if you need to. We are also in the midst of moving Sunday’s Dinner Church Service earlier, as well as launching Waffle Church and Kids’ Church service that are geared toward childrens’ leadership and participation.</p>
      <h3 class="question">Is St. Lydia's wheelchair accessible?</h3>
      <p class="answer">By this fall, our space will be wheelchair accessible. St. Lydia's is located on the first floor, but there is a small step to enter the building. The bathroom is fully accessible.</p>
      <h3 class="question">Where do you meet? Do you have your own building?</h3>
      <p class="answer">We have our own storefront, located at 304 Bond Street in Brooklyn, where we hold worship, as well as our <a href="<?php echo get_site_url(); ?>/co-working/">Co-working space</a> for freelancers.</p>
      <h3 class="question">Is St. Lydia’s affiliated with a Christian denomination?</h3>
      <p class="answer">St. Lydia’s is affiliated with the <a href="http://www.elca.org/">Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</a>. We are also in partnership with the <a href="http://www.dioceselongisland.org/">Episcopal Diocese of Long Island</a>. Our Pastor, Emily Scott, is an ordained pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.</p>
      <h3 class="question">I'm visiting with a group or from out of town to learn about St. Lydia's.</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>We're glad you'd like to visit St. Lydia's, and are happy to welcome groups of 4-6 people. Because St. Lydia's is a fairly intimate experience (generally 30 or so people at each service) groups much larger than that can be a little overwhelming for the congregation. If your group is larger than 4-6, you might consider splitting over a Sunday and Monday night. Please write us as far in advance as possible and let us know you're coming so we can make sure to cook enough food!</p>
        <p>St. Lydia's is a small and growing congregation, and as we've grown, we've been glad to welcome and get to know folks who come from around the country to worship with us. However, as the number of visitors has increased, we've needed to be mindful of the impact this has on the congregation. Here are a few ways to make your pilgrimage to St. Lydia's work well for you and for the congregation.</p>
        <h4>Be a participant in worship, rather than an observer.</h4>
        <p>We're here to make worship together, and so are you! When you arrive at St. Lydia's, you'll be invited to help create our liturgy, by cooking in the kitchen or setting the table. Jump in! You're part of what we're doing together.</p>
        <h4>Engage in conversation during worship, saving your questions for after the service.</h4>
        <p>Our congregants come to St. Lydia's to experience the Divine. Some of them come every week, others are coming for the very first time, perhaps with some fear or trepidation about attending church. They're there to build relationships. When you're a curious visitor, it can be tempting to pepper congregants with questions. However, this can make us feel like we're being interviewed when we're just trying to worship. Please save your questions about St. Lydia's and the way we worship until after the service. Emily will be more than glad to speak with you afterward.</p>
        <p>At the dinner table, we invite you to simply engage those around you about normal old things. "Where are you from?" "How long have you lived in New York?" and "What were you up to this week?" are all great conversation starters.</p>
        <h4>After the service, attend a "What Did You Notice" session.</h4>
        <p>Often after the service, our rehearsal leader will draw the worship leaders and whoever else is interested together for a "what did you notice" session. This is a time for leaders to simply notice what happened during the service. It's a great time for you to learn about the way the service is put together and our values in carrying it out.</p>
        <h4>Do some reading in advance.</h4>
        <p>There are a number of resources available that can help you learn about St. Lydia's in advance of your visit. This article in <a href="http://www.faithandleadership.com/features/articles/dinner-and-the-gospel-served-st-lydias">Faith and Leadership</a> describes how we got started, and this <a href="http://www.nyspirit.com/issue/168/spirit-interview/hungry-for-a-connection">interview with Emily</a> may be helpful to you. We also recommend this longer radio interview on <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/lifecoachradionetwork/2015/01/27/spiritually-speaking-with-rev-jen-and-rebecca">Spiritually Speaking</a>, in which Emily describes the process of St. Lydia's getting off the ground.</p>
        <p>If you're interested in how we plan our worship, you can look at our <a href="http://stlydias.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Script_for_Fall_2012.pdf">script</a>. Our <a href="http://stlydias.org/blog/">blog</a> is also a treasure trove of information.  <a href="http://stlydias.org/blog/category/squeezebox/">"Squeezebox"</a> is a section where we post all the music we sing in worship. There are blog posts about our practice of singing <a href="http://stlydias.org/blog/2013/06/songs-for-saint-lydias%E2%80%94how-we-choose-our-repertoire/">here</a>, <a href="http://stlydias.org/blog/2013/06/the-spiritual-practice-of-song-leading-at-saint-lydias/">here</a> and <a href="http://stlydias.org/blog/2013/06/what-song-leaders-work-on-in-rehearsal/">here</a>.

        <h4>Make an offering.</h4>
        <p>It takes a lot of dough to run a Dinner Church! Our operating budget includes money for rent, salaries, supplies, and of course, the food that we put on the table twice a week. Congregants who attend each week and donors from all across the country are an integral part of keeping our doors open and the lights on at St. Lydia's. We invite you to participate in building St. Lydia's by offering your support. You can offer cash in the plate when you visit, or you can take a few moments to donate online by clicking the green button on the top right of this page. Consider making a recurring gift! It's folks like you who make St. Lydia's a reality.</p>

      <h3 class="question">Is St. Lydia’s an Emergent Church?</h3>
      <p class="answer">Probably! “Emergent Church” is a label that has been used to refer to Christians who are rethinking Christianity in the context of Postmodernism. St. Lydia’s fits into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_church">Emergent Church movement</a>, but also differs from many churches in the movement. Like many emergent churches, St. Lydia’s is structured to function more like a grassroots community than an institution or an organization. Many emergent churches look to ancient models of church to inform their worship; we have done the same.</p>
      <h3 class="question">Who was St. Lydia?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>St. Lydia appears in the book of Acts. She was a wealthy businesswoman who sold purple cloth. As the head of her household, she was a church leader who hosted the new church in Philippi, and is remembered for her hospitality:</p>
        <blockquote><i>The Lord opened her heart to listen eagerly to what was said by Paul. When she and her household were baptized, she urged us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come and stay at my home.</i></blockquote>
        <p>Acts 16:14–15</p>
      </div>
      <h3 class="question">How did St. Lydia's get started?</h3>
      <p class="answer">St. Lydia’s was founded by our Pastor, Emily Scott, in the fall of 2008 in collaboration with congregants, friends, mentors, and colleague <a href="http://heartell-press.myshopify.com/">Rachel Pollak Kroh</a>. We met in the home of one of our congregants, then began to partner with a Lutheran congregation in the East Village, called <a href="http://trinitylowereastside.org/">Trinity Lower East Side</a>. A year later, we brought Rachel on board as our first Community Coordinator, and began to worship every Sunday evening. In the summer of 2011, our congregation affiliated with the <a href="http://www.elca.org/">Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</a>, and developed a partnership with the <a href="http://www.dioceselongisland.org/">Episcopal Diocese of Long Island</a>. We worshipped for over two years at the <a href="https://brooklynzen.org/">Brooklyn Zen Center</a>, then raised funds to move to our own storefront at 304 Bond Street in Brooklyn. To hear the whole story, listen to Emily's interview on <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/lifecoachradionetwork/2015/01/27/spiritually-speaking-with-rev-jen-and-rebecca">Spiritually Speaking</a>.</p>
